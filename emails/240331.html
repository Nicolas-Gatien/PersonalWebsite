                <p>From:<br> Nicolas J. Gatien<br>Ottawa, Ontario <br>Sunday, 11:52 p.m. <br>March 31th, 2024 </p>
                
                <p>Dear Friend, </p>
    
                <p>My mission is to help build human-level artificial intelligence. Here's a recap of last week. (Not in chronological order)</p>
            </div>

            <div class="gray-section">
                <h2 class="center">Cellular Automata Life Explorer</h2>
                <hr class ="section-divider">
                <p>I find the concept of life in cellular automata beautiful. Both from Conway's Game of Life to Lenia:</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="/imgs/conway.gif" alt="Conway" style="width:100%">
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="/imgs/lenia_small.gif" alt="Lenia" style="width:100%">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Both of these simulations are versions of cellular automata. A cellular automata is a grid of pixels, where the state of each pixel is determined by a set of rules.                </p>
                <p>In the Game of Life, the rules are:
<br>
                    1. If a cell is dead, it becomes alive if it has exactly 3 living neighbours.
                    <br>
                    2. If a cell is alive, it dies of isolation if it has 0 or 1 living neighbours.
                    <br>
                    3. If a cell is alive, it dies of overpopulation if it has 4 or more living neighbours.</p>
                <p>Lenia on the other hand doesn't have rules per say. It is a convolutional cellular automata. Instead of having rules, it applies a kernel to the entire board on every timestep.</p>
                <p>In both cases, it leads to interesting life forms emerging. Over the last week I've been working on a system that explores these environments to try and find settings that lead to the creation of life forms.</p>
                <p>Up until now, no luck. I plan to write a full article about this project soon, and you'll be notified when I do. For now, here are some cool GIFs of the results of my simulations searching for life forms.</p>
